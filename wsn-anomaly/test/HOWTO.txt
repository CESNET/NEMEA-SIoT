RECORDINGS
    * Contain UniRec traffic recorded by NEMEA module logger
    * Almost every recordig has two versions: normal and time
    * Time version extends normal one by timestamp
    * You can replay every recording by NEMEA module logreplay
    * If logreplay finds a timestamp it replays traffic according to the timestamp. Otherwise, it will replay all data immediately.
    * Tests for periodic check were not possible to record because actual time is required in these check. In the appropriate files (onExport-z-wave-periodic-time.log, ble-periodic-time.log) are hints for generating the traffic.

RECORDED ANOMALY TYPES
    * ble-dos: contain different increase ratio for BLE network
    * z-wave-dos-driver: contain different increase ratio for Z-Wave network
    * z-wave-dos-node: contain different increace ratio for Z-Wave sensor
    * ble-periodic-time: hints for generation periodic BLE traffic
    * onExport-z-wave-periodic: hints for generation periodic Z-Wave traffic
    * onExport-dataLimit-virtual: contain increase/decrease of sensor values
    * z-wave-connection: contain changes in communication channel quality stats
    * z-wave-measurement: test traffic used for measurements profile items

    * each line represents one testing scenario

HOW TO RUN A TEST
    1. Prepare detector configuration file (config.txt)
        SOFCount: 10;12;11;delta;-;-;-;profile(moving_average,moving_variance,moving_median,average,);moving_average(-,-,-,-,-,5,0.2,0,0,);moving_variance(-,-,-,-,-,5,0.2,0,0,);average(-,-,-,-,-,5,0.2,0,0,);moving_median(-,-,-,-,-,5,0.2,0,0,);export(-,);

    2. Run logger for alert output interface
        logger -t -T -i u:alert

    3. Optionaly you can run more logger instances for periodic export feature

    4. Run detector (you can remove or increase the vebose mode)
        ./wsn-anomaly -i "u:zwave,u:alert" -c config.txt -v

    5. Run logreplay for recorded traffic
        * logreplay -i "u:zwave" -f z-wave-connection.log -n
