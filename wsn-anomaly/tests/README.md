# Tests for WSN anomaly modules
    All test input datasets contain UniRec records which simulates traffic statistics traffic captured by [NEMEA Collector](https://github.com/CESNET/siotgateway/blob/master/src/core/NemeaCollector.cpp)

## BLE DoS
    Use Case: To simulate DoS attack in BLE network we used simple script that gathers data from a BLE sensor and it changed reading frequency which increase/descrease number of messages. In this case the time series length is five, no incoming messages are ignored and anomaly limit is two times exceed.
    Test: Learning time-series rotation, ignore phase, custom id, grow_up/grow_down detection
    Configuration Header: {UniRec key: rxBytes, id: 1112}

### input
    First 8 messages are used for learning where byte difference between two messages is 29 bytes. Next 2 messages contain valid data. From 11th received message start DoS attack that is detected from 13th message by moving_average and moving_variance values.
    
### expected output
    In the output are expected 11 messages indicating continuos growth of rxBytes. At the end you can see grow up alert messages for average and moving_average that confirm this continuos growth.

## Data Limit
    Use Case: This test is focused on detection of violation of defined data limits. The aim is to detects unexpected violations agaist defined profilies configuration. The data were generated by virtual sensors in BeeeOn gateway.
    Test: hard_min/hard_max detection
    Configuration header: {UniRec key: VALUE, id: -}

### input
    First 4 messages are used for learning. Next 6 messages contain low values that should violate lower configured rules. Last 6 messages contain high values that should violate upper limits.

### expected output
    At first there is minimal hard limit alert for moving_median. Second alert contains minimal hard limit violation by moving_average and moving_median. After that the grace period is exeeded and soft limit violation is visible. Last 4 alerts cover detection of higher values. The growth is smooth. Therefore, there is soft limit alert followed by hard limit alert.

// zkotrolovat, zde se to detekuje pro oba senzory
## Z-Wave Connection
    Use Case:
    Test: store mode, filter profile values, simple learning queue

// podivat se co je tam detekovano, ale jinak taky smazat
## Z-Wave Driver DoS
    Use Case:
    Test:
    Configuration Header: other profile values

// smazat z-wave-dos-node
## Z-Wave Node DoS 
    Use Case:
    Test:
