# Below configuration examples are focused on detection of data periodicity. The aim is to detect violation of expected periodicity. No profile configuration is need for this type ofdetection because periodic control is set by parametr in the group of general parameters. However, at least one profile item is required in configuration. 
# If you want to apply a configuration for wsn-anomaly detector, uncomment specific line and run wsn-anomaly with this configuration file.
# Detailed description see above each configuration.

#********************************** TEST4: Periodic ************************************
#***************************************************************************************
# DESCRIPTION #
# This simple confiration just test if event onExport generated by BeeeOn collector sends at least one message in eight seconds. If no data is received in eight seconds an alert is generated. 
# To try this configuration we don't any any recorded traffic file because actual time is neccasary. However, hits for generating traffic for this rules are in this file: onExport-z-wave-periodic-time.log

#********************************** TEST5: Periodic ************************************
#***************************************************************************************

# DESCRIPTION #
# Some events are periodic by default in BeeeOn gateway. This configuration is able to detect a case when receiving data are unchangeable which could represent disconnecting or lossing a sensor. This configuration check rxEvents fields from onHciStats BeeeOn event. An alert is generated if no data are sent in seven seconds or the rxEvent value is the same in five successive checks.
# To try this configuration we don't any any recorded traffic file because actual time is neccasary. However, hits for generating traffic for this rules are in this file: ble-periodic-time.log

# CONFIGURATION # 
#rxEvents: 5;8;0;simple;7;5;-;profile(moving_variance,);moving_variance(-,-,-,-,-,2,0.5,0,0,);export(-,);
