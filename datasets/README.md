IoT Datasets
===============
This folder includes IoT datasets for treat detection and ML trainig purposes. Extended flow data was created by [Joy tool](https://github.com/cisco/joy). Used initial parameters you can see in bash scripts.

Datasets for each device/protocol are stored in seperate folders. You can see their description [below](Dataset Description). Folders [data-sets](data-sets) and [annotated-data-sets](annotated-data-sets) are almost the same. The only difference is that flows in [annotated-data-sets](annotated-data-sets) folder have field "flow type" that was added by scirpt "annotate-data-flow.py". This script is part of each dataset type.
